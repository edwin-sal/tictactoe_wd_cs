                TicTacToe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is regarded as one
                of the oldest known games in history dating back to ancient
                Egypt. While its exact origins are unclear, tic-tac-toe like
                games have been discovered carved into Egyptian artifacts from
                as early as 1300 BC. The modern iteration of the game placed
                onto a 3x3 grid became popularized in the 19th century. Through
                much of its history, tic-tac-toe was mainly a simple children's
                game often played using pen and paper. However, its minimalist
                and low-skill nature also made it useful for studying early game
                theory concepts such as optimal play strategies. By the 1950s,
                mathematicians had proven that if both players are playing
                perfectly, the game must always end in a draw.

                In the modern era, tic-tac-toe has taken on a new life with the
                development of artificial intelligence. Now, tic-tac-toe is
                often used to test new AI and machine learning algorithms due to
                the game's small scope and established optimal solutions.
                Programmers will develop AI's to play against each other in
                tic-tac-toe matches millions of times in order to refine their
                strategies and techniques. Some AI's have become so advanced
                that they are capable of perfect play, never losing, even
                against human grandmasters of the game. The simplicity of
                tic-tac-toe has made it an ideal platform for researching new
                developments in AI technology from neural networks to game
                theory optimization.
