                  TicTacToe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is regarded as
                  one of the oldest known games in history dating back to
                  ancient Egypt. While its exact origins are unclear,
                  tic-tac-toe like games have been discovered carved into
                  Egyptian artifacts from as early as 1300 BC. The modern
                  iteration of the game placed onto a 3x3 grid became
                  popularized in the 19th century. Through much of its history,
                  tic-tac-toe was mainly a simple children's game often played
                  using pen and paper. However, its minimalist and low-skill
                  nature also made it useful for studying early game theory
                  concepts such as optimal play strategies. By the 1950s,
                  mathematicians had proven that if both players are playing
                  perfectly, the game must always end in a draw.

                  In the modern era, tic-tac-toe has taken on a new life with
                  the development of artificial intelligence. Now, tic-tac-toe
                  is often used to test new AI and machine learning algorithms
                  due to the game's small scope and established optimal
                  solutions. Programmers will develop AI's to play against each
                  other in tic-tac-toe matches millions of times in order to
                  refine their strategies and techniques. Some AI's have become
                  so advanced that they are capable of perfect play, never
                  losing, even against human grandmasters of the game. While
                  humans still enjoy playing for fun, artificial intelligence
                  systems have advanced to a point where they can no longer be
                  defeated by humans in a tic-tac-toe game.
